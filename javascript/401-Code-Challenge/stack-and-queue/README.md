# Stacks and Queues

- A **stack** is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

- A **Queue** is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.

## Challenge
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

## Approach & Efficiency
 * Big O of Stack
>
>Access: O(N)
>
>Search: O(N)
>
>Insert: O(1)
>
>Delete: O(1)
>

 * Big O of Queue
> 
>Access: O(N)
>
>Search: O(N)
>
>Insert: O(1)
>
>Delete: O(1)
>
